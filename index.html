            <h1>PEOPLE & CULTURE</h1>
            <p>
              The Japanese are famous for their willingness to work very hard.
              Children are taught to show respect for others, especially parents
              and bosses. They learn to do what's best for their family or
              company and worry less about their own needs. Japanese food is
              very different from food in Western countries. There is lots of
              rice, fish, and vegetables, but little meat. With little fat or
              dairy, this diet is very healthy, which helps Japanese people
              live, on average, longer than any other people in the world.

            <h1>NATURE</h1>
            <p>
              The Japanese people have a deep affection for the beauty of the
              landscape. The ancient Shinto religion says natural features like
              mountains, waterfalls, and forests have their own spirits, like
              souls. Most of Japan is covered by countryside. But with more than
              100 million people living in such a small place, wildlife has
              suffered. Pollution is now tightly controlled, but road building
              and other human activities have harmed natural habitats. About 136
              species in Japan are listed as endangered. The warm Tsushima
              Current flows from the south into the Sea of Japan, where it meets
              a colder current from the north. The mixing of waters makes the
              seas around Japan very rich in fish and other sea life.

      <h1 class="transportation">Transportation options!</h1>
      <p>
        Japanese public transportation is very well organized and accommodating.
        Rail lines connect most parts of the country. Buses, taxis and other
        vehicles are used for transit to remote or less traveled locations,
        while airplanes link the country for faster commuting over greater
        distances.

              Fushimi Inari Shrine (伏見稲荷大社, Fushimi Inari Taisha) is an
              important Shinto shrine in southern Kyoto. It is famous for its
              thousands of vermilion torii gates, which straddle a network of
              trails behind its main buildings. The trails lead into the wooded
              forest of the sacred Mount Inari, which stands at 233 meters and
              belongs to the shrine grounds.
